Finding places to eat in Singapore can be a bit overwhelming. There are many restaurants to choose from, but sometimes you just want a cheaper and more local experience. We’ve found some very good places to eat in Singapore, and best of all: these places are all cheap! 

## Hawker centres in Singapore

Eating at a hawker centre is a must in Singapore. Hawker centres are open-air food courts and typically serve Asian food. Hawker centres are cheap places to eat and offer a local experience of Singaporean and Asian food. Our go to food at hawker centres in Singapore is satay. Singaporean satay is delicious so make sure to give it a try!

### Makansutra Gluttons Bay

Makansutra Gluttons Bay is one of the hawker centres we’ve found and is located near Marina Bay. At Makansutra Gluttons Bay you can find very delicious satay for a low price (win-win!). It's not a very large hawker centre (approx. 10-15 stalls), which is a good thing in our opinion as it makes it easier to choose what to eat. However, the downside is that it can be very crowded and there might not be enough seats.

### Satay by the Bay

Satay by the Bay is another hawker centre, situated in the Gardens by the Bay. The walk from Marina Bay to Satay by the Bay is actually quite long, but as you walk along the water in a nice atmosphere, we didn't mind it at all. There is parking space nearby so it's easy to get there by car or Uber/Grab as well. Satay by the Bay is larger than Makansutra Gluttons Bay and as it’s a bit harder to get to, it also means it's less crowded. The satay is just as good here and the food is cheap. They are open during daytime as well, so if you're spending the day in the Gardens by the Bay, it's a great place to grab some food!

## Food court in The Shoppes at Marina Bay

Almost every mall in Singapore has a food court, often situated on the lower ground floor. The food court we liked best is the one in the Shoppes at Marina Bay. The food in these food courts is comparable to the hawker centers, however prices in the food courts are often a bit higher but still very reasonable. Moreover, as the hawker centres typically are outside on the streets, there is no air conditioning as is present in the malls’ food courts. The food court in the Shoppes at Marina Bay is our favorite as it offers the best atmosphere and the location is great if you're spending the day near Marina Bay for sightseeing.

## Marché Mövenpick

If you're tired of Asian food and you're looking for a nice and affordable place to have some Western food, you should definitely go to Marché. In Singapore, Marché is located in the Raffles City mall. They offer pizzas, pastas, grilled meat and fish, savory crêpes and they are all very good! When you enter the restaurant, you receive a card that you have to scan every time you order food. This system is used more often in Europe which contributes to the Western experience. This is the place to go when you want to take a short break of the Asian experience!
