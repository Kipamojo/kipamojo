To be honest, we're not big Asian food lovers. We like some chicken rice or noodle dish from time to time, but to us, Asian food quickly becomes boring. However, besides our regular (sometimes too regular) visits to McDonald's, we discovered some nice places to eat in Singapore.

## Makansutra Gluttons Bay

Makansutra Gluttons Bay is a so-called hawker center near Marina Bay where they serve very delicious satay for a low price (win-win!). It's not a very large hawker center (approx. 10-15 stalls), which is a good thing in our opinion as it makes it easier to choose what to eat. However, the downside is that it can be very crowded and there might not be enough seats.

## Satay by the Bay

Satay by the Bay is another hawker center, situated in the Gardens by the Bay. The walk from Marina Bay to Satay by the Bay is actually quite long, but as you walk along the water in a nice atmosphere, we didn't mind it all. There is parking space nearby so it's easy to get there by car or Uber/Grab as well. Satay by the Bay is larger than Makansutra Gluttons Bay which means it's less crowded. The satay is just as good here and the food is cheap. They are also open during daytime, so if you're spending the day in the Gardens by the Bay it's a great place to grab some food!

## Food court in The Shoppes at Marina Bay

Almost every mall in Singapore has a food court, often situated on the lower ground floor. The food court we liked best is the one in the Shoppes at Marina Bay. The food in these food courts is comparable to the hawker centers, however prices in the food courts are often a bit higher but still very reasonable. Moreover, as the hawker centers are placed on the street, there is no air conditioning as is present in the food courts. The food court in The Shoppes is our favorite as it offers the best atmosphere and the location is great if you're spending the day near by Marina Bay for sightseeing.

## Marché Mövenpick

If you're tired of Asian food and you're looking for a nice and affordable place to have some Western food, you should definitely try Marché. In Singapore, Marché is located in the Raffles City mall. They offer pizzas, pastas, grilled meat and fish, savoury crêpes and they are all very good! When you enter you receive a card that you have to scan every time you order food. This system is used more often in Europe (Vapiano, anyone?) which contributes to the Western experience. This is the place to go when you want to take a short break of the Asian experience!
