# Our Favorite Spring Photos

Spring is the perfect season to take photos of all the pretty blossoms and blooms. And that's exactly what we've been doing the past weeks. We're sharing our favorite spring photos with you, hoping these photos will put a smile on your face. 

Don't forget to check out our post on [How to Enjoy Spring From Home During Lockdown][spring from home]{:target="_blank"}.

## Flowers

During spring, you'll find plenty of flowers everywhere you go. All kinds of flowers are beautiful but Mika's favorite are cherry blossoms. She'll do anything to find as many cherry blossom trees as possible in our neighborhood, and of course she has to take photos of them!

## Greenery

Besides all the blossoms and blooms, everything is also turning green during spring. The trees grow their green leaves back again, and the grass looks greener as usual. Everywhere you go, you see signs of new life. All animals are getting active again, and even though we haven't spotted any newborns yet, we don't think it'll take much longer.

## Sky

We've been experiencing some great spring weather over the past weeks and it's just a delight to take photos of the sky. You don't even have to leave your house to see the blue sky. Just look out the window and there it is! (And open the window to take a photo of it, haha.)

## Sunset

Another one of our favorite things about spring, are the longer days. Every evening, the sun sets a little later and we just love it. It makes it easier to go outside to see the sunset as you have plenty of time to do so. And sometimes it looks like the sunsets in spring are even more dramatically, but maybe that's just us.
