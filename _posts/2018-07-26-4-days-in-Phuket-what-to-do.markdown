After our first stay in Kuala Lumpur, we flew to the Thai island of Phuket. We stayed  there for 4 nights, which is way too short if you want to explore the island. We were in a town called Tambon Choeng Thale, which is a half-hour walk or a 10-minute drive away from the nearest beach, [Bangtao Beach][maps bangtao beach].

We liked the area of Tambon Choeng Thale as it was close to a variety of restaurants, a supermarket and a day/night market. The [Bangtao Market][maps bangtao market] is open on Mondays and Thursdays from 14:00-20:00. The [Tinlay Night Market][maps tinlay market] is open on Wednesdays, Fridays Saturdays and Sundays, from 16:00-22:00. If you're in the area, both markets are nice to wander around.

The only things we really did during our stay in Phuket were wandering around the town and walking to the beach. We enjoyed this a lot. Phuket has some very nice island vibes and the people on the island are super nice. Tambon Choeng Thale is not that touristic, which is a big advantage. If we had more time we would have definitely rented a scooter to explore more of the island. Phuket is a pretty big island, so if you want to explore it more, consider staying more than a week in a central area.
