## Damrak

The gingerbread houses at Damrak might be Amsterdam's most famous Instagrammable spot. You can't miss snapping a photo here. Damrak is located between Amsterdam Central Station and Dam Square and that means it's always very crowded. If you want to take a photo right in front the houses, you have to go early to avoid the crowds.

You can also shoot the houses from another angle. Get down the stairs of the bridge next to Damrak. To get to the stairs, you have to climb the railing and some bikes. From this platform, you can take a beautiful photo of you and the gingerbread houses. This spot usually isn't crowded so no need to get up early for this angle!

## Papiermolensluis

The Papiermolensluis is a well-known Instagrammable spot located in the Jordaan district. Three canals come together at this spot which makes it one of the busiest waterways of Amsterdam. The iconic Instagram photo looks out over the café “Het Papeneiland across the canal, but you can also take a beautiful photo overlooking the “Brouwersgracht” canal. If you go early and the weather conditions are cooperating, you might even get a beautiful reflection on the water.

## Westerkerk

The Westerkerk is a renaissance styled church that has been constructed between 1620-1631. The church is mentioned a few times in Anne Frank’s diary as her hiding place was very close to the Westerkerk. You have a beautiful view of the Westerkerk across the water from the “Kees de Jongenbrug”. It’s the perfect spot to snap your Instagram photo of the Westerkerk.

## Begijnhof

Begijnhof is a “hofje” which is a courtyard surrounded by (usually) small houses. The houses in Begijnhof aren’t very small though. Begijnhof is located very close to the busy shopping area of Amsterdam, but it’s such a peaceful place. The courtyard is constructed in the Middle Ages and it’s a unique experience to catch a glimpse of medieval Amsterdam. A part of the courtyard is closed off to safeguard peace and silence for the inhabitants, so you can’t wander around the yard. However, there are still lots of possibilities to take a photo with this medieval courtyard in the background.

## Amsterdam Flower Market 

You can’t visit Amsterdam without stopping by the Flower Market (Bloemenmarkt). You can buy all kinds of things such as fresh flowers, fake flowers, flower seeds, flower bulbs and souvenirs. At most stands, you’re not allowed to take photos inside. If it’s not too crowded, there are lots of possibilities to take photos in front of the stands. You can find the most Instagrammable stand by entering the Flower Market from Muntplein. The first stand has a large variety of fresh flowers in front of the stall and lots of colors inside, which works perfect on an Instagram photo!

## Amstel river area

The Amstel river area is beautiful to walk around, especially on a sunny day. There are a few spots where you can sit on the river bank and watch the boats floating by. These spots also make the perfect photo opportunity.

When you’re wandering around the Amstel river area, you can’t miss the Magere Brug (or Skinny Bridge) which is a drawbridge crossing the Amstel. It’s a lovely photo spot during the day with the iconic bridge and the gingerbread houses in the background. The bridge is filled with lights that light it up at night which also makes it a beautiful photo spot. If you can, go during the day and at night

Another Instagrammable spot in the Amstel river area is from the Walter Süskind Bridge, which is yet another drawbridge. If you’re lucky, you get to snap the opening of the bridge just like we did, and watch the boats floating by. You just can’t go wrong with Amsterdam canal photos in your Instagram feed.

## Hortus Botanicus

The Hortus Botanicus is Amsterdam’s botanical garden and has lots of Instagrammable spots. The botanical garden features three gardens and three greenhouses. We especially loved the Palm Greenhouse where you can climb the stairs and walk among the tall palm trees. The desert part of the Three Climate Greenhouse offers great backgrounds for your Instagram photos too. But these aren’t the only Instagram-worthy spots. Wandering around the Hortus Botanicus, you’ll find many more!
