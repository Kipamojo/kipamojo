Since (unfortunately) not everything in Singapore is free, here are a few worthwhile attractions that cost some dollars.
<br><br>

### River Cruise

The River Cruise starts at Clarke Quay and rides down the river to Marina Bay. Even if you've already walked that part along the river, it's still very nice to see the buildings from the water. Just lean back, relax and let the wind breeze through your hair while you enjoy Singapore's beautiful scenery!  
  
Price:   
SGD 25 (adult)

### SkyPark Observation Deck at Marina Bay Sands

The view from the SkyPark of Marina Bay Sands is simply amazing. On the one side, there is the stunning view over the Gardens by the Bay, while on the other side Marina Bay and Singapore's beautiful skyline can be seen. If you get up there early, it's not packed with tourists yet and you'll have the Deck (almost) to yourself.  
  
Price:   
SGD 23 (adult) 

Note: After we visited the SkyPark we found out that it's also possible to get to the bar next to the SkyPark, without having to pay the SkyPark ticket. This will save you a lot of money as you only have to pay for your drink. We didn't have the time to try this, so we're not sure if it (still) works.

### Gardens by the Bay

Large parts of the Gardens are free of charge except for the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and the OCBC Skyway. We actually didn't visit any of these as we already spend so much time in the free part of the Gardens. Still we wanted to share them as they seem amazing and we will definitely visit them next time we're in Singapore.

Price:   
SGD 28 (adult - combination price for Flower Dome and Cloud Forest)  
SGD 8 (adult - OCBC Skyway)

### 1-Altitude Rooftop Bar

1-Altitude is a must visit when in Singapore. The rooftop bar offers an amazing view over the city, especially during sunset. Besides the amazing view, we particularly love the palm trees that really create a tropical vibe which is all you need while sipping your cocktail! It's also possible to visit the venue during daytime when it's called the Viewing Gallery.  

Price:   
SGD 25 (8.30am - 5.30pm, including1 non-alcoholic drink)  
SGD 30 (6pm - 9pm, including 1 drink)  
SGD 35 (after 9pm, including 1 drink)  

Tip: on Wednesday nights it's ladies' night which means free entrance for ladies!

### Cable Car to Sentosa Island 

We like cable car rides so we just had to check out the Cable Car to Sentosa Island. We actually didn't take the ride on [the day we visited Sentosa Island][budget-post], but it's typically a nice way to travel to and from Sentosa Island. There are two lines that are connected with each other: the Mount Faber Line and the Sentosa Line. The Mount Faber line starts (surprisingly) at the Mount Faber peak, rides through a skyscraper and ends in the center of Sentosa Island. From there you can take the Sentosa Line to either Merlion or Siloso Point. The Mount Faber Line is more impressive as the ride is a lot higher than the Sentosa Line and, therefore, the views are better. Nevertheless, taking the Sentosa Line will give you a great overview of the Island which comes in handy if you haven't visited the island before.  

Price:    
SGD 33 (adult - Mount Faber Line + Sentosa Line)  
SGD 29 (adult - Mount Faber Line)  
SGD 13 (adult - Sentosa Line)
