We’re avid sunset lovers (and sunrise if we’re able to get up early enough) and hardly ever miss one while traveling. Madrid isn’t necessarily a city you think of when thinking about sunsets, it's not Los Angeles, but the sunsets are very beautiful and there are multiple nice viewing spots. In this blog post, we’re sharing the best places to watch the sunset in Madrid!
 
## Cerro del Tío Pío Park
 
Cerro del Tío Pío Park is our favorite sunset spot. It isn’t located in the city center which makes it a little harder to get to, but the views are truly amazing and well worth the ride (by public transport). The park is located on a few hills, which all offer a beautiful view over the city and the park's neighborhood. The view is really unique with lots of orange-toned houses and buildings against a beautiful mountain backdrop. You’ll find many locals gathering in the park during sunset, no matter what day of the week.

### Getting to Cerro del Tío Pío Park

From Puerta del Sol, take metro line 1 in the direction of Valdecarros and get off at Buenos Aires. Walk up north along Calle de Pío Felipe and take a left turn into the park before the roundabout. Now the only thing you have to do is look for a nice spot on a hilltop. It takes around 30 minutes to get to Cerro del Tío Pío Park from Puerta del Sol.

## Bridge of Toledo in Madrid Rio
 
Madrid Rio is a park that stretches all the way along the borders of the Manzanares river. It’s the perfect place for a morning or afternoon walk but it's also a beautiful spot to watch the sunset from. Especially the Bridge of Toledo (Puente de Toledo) offers a beautiful view of the park and the sky during sunset. It’s not a popular sunset spot so you’ll probably be the only one around which makes it perfect in our opinion.

### Getting to the Bridge of Toledo

The Bridge of Toledo in Madrid Rio is a 30-minute walk from Puerta del Sol. The walk to the park is downhill, which means it’s uphill when you walk back to the city center. It’s also possible to get there by metro, which also takes around 30 minutes. Take metro line 5 from Callao (5-minute walk from Puerta del Sol) in the direction of Casa de Campo. Get off at Marqués de Vadillo. From there it’s a 5 minute walk up north to the Bridge of Toledo.

## Temple of Debod in Parque del Oeste
 
The Temple of Debod (Templo de Debod) is a popular spot to catch the sunset from. The ancient temple from the 2nd century is a gift from Egypt and is located in the Parque del Oeste (Western Park). The sun sets behind the temple which makes for idyllic views. Next to the temple is a viewpoint (Mirador de Templo de Debod) overlooking the Royal Palace, the Almudena Cathedral and the city. The Temple of Debod and the viewpoint are popular spots and can get really crowded during sunset, so beware of that.

### Getting to the Temple of Debod

It’s a 20-minute walk from Puerta del Sol to the Temple of Debod. It’s also possible to get there by metro. Take metro line 3 from Puerta del Sol in the direction of Moncloa and get off at Ventura Rodríguez. Take Calle de Luisa Fernanda in the southwestern direction until you reach Parque del Oeste. It takes about 15 minutes to get to the temple by metro.
 
## Royal Palace of Madrid
 
The Royal Palace of Madrid (or Palacio Real) is located on top of a hill which makes it a very well-suited spot to watch the sunset from. Especially at the top of the stairs that enter into the Sabatini Gardens you'll have a beautiful sunset view. As the area around the Royal Palace is always crowded, expect to see many people walking by and stopping to watch the beautiful sunset sky. It’s a lovely spot that’s easy to get to in the city center.

### Getting to the Royal Palace

From Puerta del Sol, it’s a 10-minute walk along Calle del Arenal to the Royal Palace. You can also take metro line 2 from Puerta del Sol in the direction of Cuatro Caminos and get out at the next stop Ópera. From Ópera it’s a 5-minute walk to the Royal Palace. In total, it’ll take around 10-15 minutes by metro, so you might as well walk.

## Retiro Park
 
We usually love to watch the sunset from a place a little higher up. Retiro Park (or Parque del Buen Retiro) isn’t located on top of a hill or higher up, but it’s still a beautiful sunset spot. For a good view, head to the Retiro Pond. It’s beautiful to see the pond in contrast to a colorful sunset sky. The Crystal Palace (or Palacio Cristal) is also a  beautiful sight in front of a sunset-colored sky.

### Getting to Retiro Park

It’s a 20 to 30-minute walk from Puerta del Sol to Retiro Park. If you want to go by metro, take line 2 from Puerta del Sol in the direction of Las Rosas and get off at the stop Retiro. The stop is at the northern entrance of the park. From there it’s a 5-minute walk to the pond and a 7-minute walk to the Crystal Palace.

## Azotea del Circulo de Bellas Artes

Circulo de Bellas Artes is a museum in the city center of Madrid. The best part of the museum is the open-air rooftop with a bar and a restaurant. It’s a nice spot for drinks or even lunch or dinner and it’s arguably the best spot to watch the sunset. The view from the rooftop over the city is amazing. Sunset is one of the most popular times of the day, so make sure you're early or you’ll have to wait in line for the elevator, and you might miss the sunset. If you want to have dinner at the restaurant, make a reservation in advance as they’re always fully booked.

### Getting to Azotea del Circulo de Bellas Artes

Circulo de Bellas Artes is close to Puerta del Sol and is only a 10-minute walk. You can also take metro line 2 from Sol in the direction of Las Rosas and get off at the next stop Sevilla. In total it also takes around 10 minutes by metro, so you might as well walk.

Don’t forget to check the sunset time and make sure to arrive in time to the sunset spot. Don’t leave immediately when the sun is set, the sky often still changes after that and that’s the moment the most dramatic colors appear. 

We hope we’ve inspired you to watch the sunset in Madrid! We’d love to know if you’ve been to any of these places, to watch the sunset or just during the day. Let us know in the comments below!
