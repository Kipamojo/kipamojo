Canggu (Bali, Indonesia) is mostly known for its laid-back vibes and Instagrammable cafés. We wandered around Canggu for four days to find the most Instagrammable places that we love sharing with you in this blog post.

## Les Basics
 
One of our favorite Instagrammable places is the pink garage door at the Les Basics shop. You have to come outside of the shop’s opening hours, otherwise the door is opened. Show your outfit in front of this pink backdrop and bring an iced latte as a nice prop. Don’t forget to check out the shop as well during opening hours; we love their clothes!

## Mad Pops
 
Mad Pops is a well-known Instagrammable place in Bali. Their neon-signed walls together with their colorful ice cream are the perfect combination for an Instagram photo. Pose in front of the wall with your scoops or get a close-up of your ice cream with the neon sign in the background.

## Paletas Wey
 
A lesser known ice cream shop in Canggu is Paletas Wey. Paletas Wey sells colorful popsicles and together with the colorful decorated walls, Paletas Wey really is an Instagrammable place. Get yourself in front of one of the decorated walls and pose! Be quick or your popsicle will melt!

## In the Raw
 
In the Raw not only serves delicious (and good-looking) food, the interior offers a few very pretty photo spots with jungle vibes which makes it a great Instagrammable place. Get yourself in the little bamboo hut and order a fruit platter and juice. The picnic tables with lots of plants in the background are a perfect spot for Instagram photos as well.

## Monsieur Spoon
 
Monsieur Spoon is a French bakery with delicious food and smoothies and is one of the most Instagrammable places in Canggu. We’d really recommend to get the Monsieur Spoon granola with yoghurt and fruit, some colorful smoothies and the French Breakfast plate. Not only does it look good, it tastes amazing! There are lots of seats with either white walls or plants in the background which both work great on your Instagram photos.

## Cocomo
 
The interior and front yard of Cocomo are very picturesque. The place is colorfully decorated with lots of pastels, which makes it a nice Instagrammable place. The front yard features lots of flowers, plants and pretty walls. There are multiple spots to take a pretty Instagram photo. Order the smoothie bowl and a juice to add even more color!

## Book yourself an Instagrammable hotel
 
In general, Bali has many amazing and affordable hotels and Canggu is no exception. Most of these hotels are very Instagrammable too, with a beautiful garden or an amazing infinity pool. In Canggu, we got ourselves a room in the Frii Hotel with direct access to the pool from our room. We could take a dip straight out of our room. How perfect is that?! We loved sitting in our room with the doors opened and our feet in the water. Together with some drinks and snacks, it was the perfect way to end the day!
