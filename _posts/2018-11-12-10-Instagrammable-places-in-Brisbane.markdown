In this post, we share with you our favorite Instagrammable places in Brisbane!

### Wheel of Brisbane

The [Wheel of Brisbane][wheel]{:target="_blank"} is located on the South Bank. In front of the wheel you’ll see a grass field along the river. This makes the perfect photo spot for a relaxed photo including you, the wheel and the river!

### South Bank Parklands

The [South Bank Parklands][south bank parklands]{:target="_blank"} are beautiful with greenery and flowers. If you choose your location wisely you can also include the Wheel of Brisbane in your shot.

### Nepalese Temple at South Bank

Walking along the South Bank you’ll stumble upon a [Nepalese Temple][nepalese temple]{:target="_blank"}. The temple is surrounded by tropical plants which make it a picture perfect spot. Wait for the crowds to pass and take a shot of you in front of the entrance, or look for another spot around the temple.

### Gallery of Modern Art

[Modern Art][goma]{:target="_blank"} usually works well on pictures. Big pro is that the light in the gallery is perfect for taking pictures too. Find your favorite art piece and shoot away!

### Queensland Art Gallery

The [Queensland Art Gallery][qag]{:target="_blank"} has a beautiful permanent piece with many silver balls floating on water in their collection which works perfect on Insta photos. Walk around the place to find the perfect perspective. Don’t forget to watch the other collections as you might find something else interesting as well!

### Reddacliff Place

At [Reddacliff Place][reddacliff place]{:target="_blank"}, in front of the Brisbane Square Library, you’ll find some huge balls. No, seriously. These, in combination with the library and maybe a beautiful sunset sky, offer the perfect background for an Insta-shot.

### Wilson Outlook Reserve

From the [Wilson Outlook Reserve][wilson outlook reserve]{:target="_blank"} you’ll have a perfect view over the [Story Bridge][story bridge]{:target="_blank"} and the skyscrapers behind it. At night, the bridge is lit up in different colors. As there is quite some lack of light at the reserve, it might be hard to properly light up both yourself and the background for an Insta picture at night. So, if you want to be in the shot, you should go during the day or use a flash.

### Eat Street Northshore

[Eat Street][eat street]{:target="_blank"} has many different photo opportunities. Look for your favorite place, order some good-looking Instagrammable food and get shooting!

### Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary

You can’t leave Australia without a picture of you and a kangaroo. [Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary][lone pine]{:target="_blank"} is perfect for that. There is a large field with 150 freely roaming kangaroos. These kangaroos are very approachable and if you buy some food at the store, they’ll come to you for sure. There are also many cute koalas to photograph and you can even hold one, if you’d like to.
