Of course self-isolation isn’t great. But since there is absolutely nothing we can do about it, why not see it from the bright side? We put together a list of 10 things we love about being in self-isolation, hoping we can provide you with some positive thoughts in these troubling times. 

Be sure to check out our [fun things to do at home during self-isolation][things to do si]{:target="_blank"}  blog as well.

## Being together 24/7

As we both have nowhere to go, we're spending all of our time together and we’re loving it! Ever since our big Asia trip, we knew we just love being together all the time. We share a desk in our home office where we spend most of our time at. Even though we don't work together, we really enjoy having a little chat, hug or kiss whenever we feel like it. For us, it's a huge advantage of the lockdown.

## Working from the couch whenever we want to 

Working from the couch really feels like a luxury. Every now and then, mostly at the end of the day, one of us generally works from the couch for a bit. We even named it the 'thinking couch' as we love it especially when our work requires us to think more.

## Going for a workout during lunch break 

We have to admit that we haven't done this, but we love that it's a possibility. Theoretically it's always possible of course, but not many people would go for a workout during lunch break when they're at the office. At least we wouldn't. Maybe we should give it a try now that we're in lockdown. 

## Taking Instagram photos at home

As much as we love to take our Instagram photos while we travel, taking Instagram photos at home isn't bad either. Confined to a small space, you have to think a little bit more outside of the box but we like that. There are endless ways to be creative while taking Instagram photos at home so you'll never run out of content.

## No commute to work 

Joop had a 3-hour daily commute to and from work and, even though he loves his job, it can be hard sometimes. Now his commute is literally 30 seconds to walk down the stairs from the bedroom to our home office. It doesn't get any better than that! 

## More free time 

With nowhere to go and without a daily commute, we have way more free time than we did before the lockdown. We specifically have way more time to spend together. In our extra free time, we've been watching a lot of TV series. Some series we finished this month are Silicon Valley, Mr. Robot and the last season of Money Heist. We're currently watching Westworld, which will keep us occupied for at least the upcoming week with 3 seasons. If you're looking for some TV series inspiration, we can recommend all of them!

## We can finally stay up after 10pm 

Before lockdown, we used to wake up very early in the morning because of Joop's daily commute. Every evening we hardly had the time to do something together as we were so tired and were in bed at 10pm already. Now, there's no need to wake up at 6am. Since we're not leaving the house, we're less active in general and less tired in the evening. So we can finally stay up after 10pm like normal people and have a decent evening together. 

## Going outside for walks

I don't think we ever went outside for a walk before the lockdown. As we're (still) allowed to go outside whenever we want, we've been making the most of it. For the most part, the weather has been great too over the past two months so that helped a lot in keeping the spirits up. It's funny how you can start to enjoy completely different things once your situation changes.

## Dalgona coffee

Of course we had to try the Dalgona coffee trend and we're absolutely hooked! It's our favorite drink, especially when the temperatures are a bit higher. Besides the great taste, the caffeine in this coffee really hits hard and sometimes (or often) that's exactly what you need. 

In case you're not familiar with the Dalgona coffee trend, it's a Korean-style iced coffee. To make this coffee you have to whip equal amounts of instant coffee powder, sugar and hot water until it becomes thick and fluffy. Add ice cubes in a glass, pour them over with milk (we use almond milk) and scoop the fluffy coffee on top of it. 

By the way, for one coffee we use 2 tablespoons of instant coffee powder, 2 tablespoons of hot water, but only half a tablespoon of sugar. This makes the consistency less fluffy, but less sugar is better.

## Slow things down 

This lockdown has forced us into slowing things down. Our agendas are empty and we have more time to focus on our passion projects instead of running around doing other things. We all have busy lives and now we can (finally) do nothing else but take it slow. We're just taking a huge break from life right now. 

We hope you were able to see some of the positive aspects of self-isolation. Of course we can't wait until things get back to normal again, but until then we have to cope with the situation as it is right now. Better make the best of it!
