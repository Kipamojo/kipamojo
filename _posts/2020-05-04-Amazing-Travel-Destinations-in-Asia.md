# For when we can safely travel again

We can’t travel right now, but we love to dream about past and future travels. No one knows how long this lockdown will last, but dreaming about traveling makes it easier for us to get through this time of self-isolation. Asia is a large continent with many interesting, unique and diverse destinations. These destinations vary from bustling cities to beautiful nature and tropical islands. Read on to find out about the 10 Destinations in Asia we’re currently dreaming about and which we can’t wait to visit when it’s safe to travel again!
 
## 1. Singapore
 
Singapore is a modern, lively city state in South East Asia. The city center of Singapore features many skyscrapers. We loved visiting the Marina Bay and it's great to take a stroll along the 3.5 km-long Marina Bay Promenade surrounding the Bay. You'll have a continuously-beautiful view of the buildings at the waterfront, the most prominent of which is the Marina Bay Sands resort. The resort is famous for its infinity pool overlooking the city, but as we weren’t staying there, we couldn’t visit the pool. We did pay a visit to the observatory platform and enjoyed an amazing view of Marina Bay, the Gardens by the Bay and the rest of Singapore.

The Gardens by the Bay are another must-visit in Singapore that we enjoyed a lot. The Gardens are famous for its Supertrees. As the name suggests, the Supertrees are huge, man-made trees. There are some very interesting facts to learn about them For example: 11 Supertrees have environmentally sustainable functions and the highest Supertree is as high as a 16-storey building. You can even walk among the Supertrees on the OCBC Skyway, which connects two Supertrees through a 128-meter-long aerial walkway.

## 2. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
 
As one of the fastest growing metropolitan regions in South East Asia, Kuala Lumpur is another modern and bustling city and we really enjoyed spending time in the city. Its ever-changing skyline features the iconic Petronas Twin Towers. We couldn’t leave the city without snapping this landmark! The KLCC Park is a good spot to do just that. The Petronas Towers also have an observatory platform, but for the best city view we’d recommend going up the Kuala Lumpur Tower. The KL Tower, as it's also called, is the 7th tallest communication tower in the world and features an observatory platform 300 meters above ground. The view from the KL Tower is just amazing! During our stay we noticed construction of multiple new skyscrapers. We’d love to go back to Kuala Lumpur to see the new additions to its skyline!

## 3. Koh Yao Yai, Thailand
 
The third destinations in Asia we’re dreaming about is a Thai island in the Andaman Sea: Koh Yao Yai. What makes Koh Yao Yai so special is its relative remoteness. Not inundated with tourists, this island has beautiful nature. It’s the perfect place to take it slow and explore. We loved exploring the many beautiful beaches on the island. Our favorites are Laem Had Beach, Loh Jak Beach and Loh Pared Bay Beach. We would love to explore the island by scooter right now and enjoy a nice fresh coconut on one of the island’s tropical beaches.

## 4. Bangkok, Thailand
 
Bangkok, the capital of Thailand is another amazing destination we can’t wait to go back to. Bangkok is a huge city with many unique temples and an amazing cuisine. While everyone says you have to eat Pad Thai in Thailand (and well, you do), our favorite Thai dish is a spicy Thai curry. Green, red or yellow, we like them all. 
 
Besides good food, the temples in Bangkok are absolutely worth visiting. Our favorite is Wat Arun and it’s really worth going to. Wat Arun is a white temple full of little details and it's a true piece of art. From Wat Arun, you can take a ferry to the other side of the Chao Phraya River, where you can find more temples, among others Wat Pho and Wat Phra Kaew. The area of the Chao Phraya River is perfect for a day of temple hopping!

## 5. Hong Kong
 
Hong Kong is by far our favorite city in Asia. Ever since we left Hong Kong, we’re dreaming of going back. The city truly amazed us with its incredible skyline. Head to the Avenue of Stars in Kowloon for an awesome view of the skyline of Hong Kong Island. For an amazing viewpoint overlooking the entire city, you have to get up the Victoria Peak. You can either hike up there or take the Peak Tram if you’re not feeling that adventurous. We can guarantee that the view will leave you speechless!

{% include img-center.html path="/assets/img/hong-kong-victoria-peak.jpg" alt="Victoria Peak in Hong Kong" %} 
 
To enjoy the colorful architecture of Hong Kong from up close, we loved visiting the Choi Hung Estate. This Estate is mostly popular by local and foreign Instagrammers and bloggers, and you’ll see many of them taking photos on the famous basketball court, while dodging the balls because there are always people actually playing basketball. So, make sure you're not in their way. The Choi Hung Estate is a beautiful sight and shouldn’t be missed during your Hong Kong visit.

## 6. Kyoto, Japan
 
As Japan’s former capital, there's a lot of culture and there are plenty traditional buildings in Kyoto. Kyoto is home to over 2000 temples and shrines, we just can’t believe how many that is! One of our favorite shrines we visited in Kyoto is the Fushimi Inari Taisha shrine. It's located at the base of a mountain and part of the shrine’s grounds are thousands of torii (gates) lining the 4-kilometer trail to the top of the mountain. The amount of torii is very impressive and they seem never ending!

{% include img-center.html path="/assets/img/kyoto-fushimi-inari-taisha.jpg" alt="Fushimi Inari Taisha in Kyoto, Japan" %} 

One of the most famous temples in Kyoto is the Kinkaku-ji, also known as the Temple of the Golden Pavilion. The temple is fully covered in gold which makes it a stunning sight. Kinkaku-ji is surrounded by a beautiful Japanese garden and the temple grounds are a lovely place to walk around and we loved visiting this unique temple in Kyoto. Kyoto, and the rest of Japan, looks like a fairytale during cherry blossom season and we’re dreaming about returning in early spring.

{% include img-center.html path="/assets/img/kyoto-kinkaku-ji-golden-pavilion-temple.jpg" alt="Kinkaku-Ji Golden Pavilion Temple in Kyoto, Japan" %} 

## 7. Mt. Fuji, Japan
 
The master of mountains: Fujisan, or more commonly known as Mt. Fuji, was on our bucket list for so long and we were so excited to finally see the mountain with our own eyes. The little village Kawaguchiko is the perfect base to admire the beauty of Mt. Fuji. Kawaguchiko is easily reachable from Tokyo by either bus or train, which makes it well-suited for a day trip. However, we decided to stay a few nights in Kawaguchiko because we wanted to experience sunrise and sunset while admiring the beautiful mountain. 

{% include img-center.html path="/assets/img/japan-mt-fuji-kawaguchiko-sunset.jpg" alt="Sunset at Mt. Fuji in Kawaguchiko, Japan" %} 

One of the most beautiful places to see Mt. Fuji from is from the famous Chureito Pagoda. The red pagoda with Mt. Fuji in the background attracts photographers and tourists from all over the world. We’re dreaming about returning to Mt. Fuji during cherry blossom season as it looks absolutely magical.

{% include img-center.html path="/assets/img/japan-mt-fuji-kawaguchiko-chureito-pagoda.jpg" alt="Mt. Fuji from the Chureito Pagoda in Japan" %} 

## 8. Seoul, Korea
 
Seoul, the capital of Korea, is another destination we’re dreaming about. You can easily spend a week in Seoul without getting bored. We loved the amazing view over the city up the Namsan Mountain. You can also find the N Seoul Tower here at the top of the mountain, which offers a 360 view of Seoul from its observatory decks. The views are beautiful at any time of the day, but sunset makes it a little more special.

{% include img-center.html path="/assets/img/seoul-view.jpg" alt="Sunset view of Seoul, Korea" %} 
 
A must-visit in Seoul is the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Gyeongbokgung used to be a royal palace and the grounds are huge. You can walk around for hours, while admiring the beautiful buildings and the stunning details. Many Koreans dress up in traditional clothing for their visit to the Palace, which we loved to see.

## 9. Nusa Penida, Indonesia
 
Nusa Penida is our favorite island in Indonesia and it’s one of those places we wanted to return to immediately after leaving the island. Even though it’s attracting more and more tourists every year, we'd still say it's not touristic. It has lots of raw nature, which we love. The nature truly is unlike anywhere else with incredible cliffs and stunning white sand beaches. A must-visit on the island is the famous Dinosaur Head cliff and Kelingking Beach. Seeing the cliff in real life is breathtakingly beautiful. If you’re feeling adventurous, climb down the stairs to the beach. The hike will last around 45 minutes and is very steep. The beach, however, is very beautiful and so worth the hike down.

{% include img-center.html path="/assets/img/bali-nusa-penida-kelingking-beach.jpg" alt="Kelingking Beach in Nusa Penida, Bali, Indonesia" %} 

Angel Billabong is the island’s famous natural infinity pool. When the tides are low, you can swim in the natural pool which is very relaxing. Next to Angel Billabong you’ll find Broken Beach, which is another spectacular sight. Broken Beach is basically another giant natural pool created by the sea. You can’t swim in this pool, however, even when the tide is low. We loved ending our days at Crystal Bay, which is the perfect spot to watch the sunset. That’s what we’re dreaming about the most right now.

## 10. Bali, Indonesia 
 
Bali is at the top of many travelers’ bucket lists. Even though it's a very touristic and crowded island, we can’t leave it off the list as the nature is just too amazing. We loved visiting the Tegallalang rice terraces, we had never seen a place like this. Tegallalang is one of the most popular places on the island, so you have to go early if you want to beat the crowds.

{% include img-center.html path="/assets/img/bali-ubud-tegallalang-rice-terrace-1.jpg" alt="Tegallalang Rice Terraces in Ubud, Bali, Indonesia" %} 

Another spot we loved in Bali is the Campuhan Ridge Walk. We found this to be a very relaxing walk. Even though the Campuhan Ridge Walk is close to the bustling center of Ubud, it felt so far away. It’s a place where you can truly come to peace and the endless greenery is amazing to admire.
