We spent four days in [Canggu][canggu]{:target="_blank"} (Bali, Indonesia), mostly eating our way around town. Canggu truly is a foodie’s paradise. Wandering through the streets, you’ll stumble upon so many good-looking cafés and restaurants that also happen to serve great food. Canggu is not a big town which makes it the perfect place to check out many different kinds of cafés and restaurants, all within walking distance. In this post we share our favorite places to eat in Canggu.  
 
## Monsieur Spoon
 
[Monsieur Spoon][monsieur spoon]{:target="_blank"} is a French bakery and quickly became our favorite breakfast spot in Canggu. After traveling through Asia for so long, we were so happy to find French bakeries in Bali (read about the [French bakery in Ubud here][ubud eat]{:target="_blank"}). We missed freshly baked bread so much and Monsieur Spoon was the perfect place for our fresh bread fix. They serve delicious smoothies and yoghurt bowls as well. And let’s not forget their croissants and pain au chocolats, so good! We didn’t try their cakes and pies but they looked very yummy too. We came back here multiple times for breakfast.

## Cocomo
 
We stumbled upon [Cocomo][cocomo]{:target="_blank"} when strolling the streets of Canggu. The pretty and colorful interior looked very inviting, so we just had to check this place out. The front garden is beautiful with lots of plants, trees and colorful pillows. The interior offered many Instagrammable photo spots, which is what we’re all looking for in Balinese cafés right!? We loved their fresh juices and smoothies and the food was good too. We actually were surprised this place wasn’t more popular like the other “famous” Instagrammable cafés in Bali (for which you have to wait in line to get a table). Cocomo is the perfect place for those pretty Instagram shots without the crowds!

## In the Raw
 
[In the Raw][in the raw]{:target="_blank"} quickly became one of our favorite lunch spots. The prices are a bit higher than average but it’s absolutely worth it as their food is so good! The seating area is entirely outside but is covered by a bamboo roof. The interior features lots of bamboo and plants, which makes you feel like you’re in a jungle. There are multiple Instagrammable photo opps which makes it even more perfect. Their juices are the best (especially the watermelon one) and they serve a fruit platter with typical Balinese fruits, like mangosteen, rambutan and jackfruit, which was very interesting to try. In the Raw is definitely a must-go when you’re in Canggu.

## The Loft
 
[The Loft][the loft]{:target="_blank"} is one of those popular restaurants in Bali we’ve heard of before. When we found out they had a location in Canggu, we decided to check it out. We went there for dinner, which isn’t the perfect time for Instagram shots, but we came to enjoy the food anyway. All of their food is vegan, but unlike many other vegan restaurants, their food was very tasteful and it didn’t feel like something was missing. The only downside of this place was that the staff can be a bit blunt.
 
The interior of The Loft is pretty, with lots of whites. There’s a small outside seating area with a nice pink wall which is great for Instagram photos. We walked past this place multiple times during the day and it often was very crowded. When we went there for dinner, it wasn’t crowded at all. If you just want to enjoy the food, the evening is the perfect time to go. If you want to take photos at The Loft during the day, you might need to wait for a table.

## Lacalita Bar y Cocina
 
[Lacalita][lacalita]{:target="_blank"} is a Mexican restaurant and bar and is the perfect place for some cocktails and tacos. At night, this place is bustling and you might have to queue up. The atmosphere is amazing, the food is great and there’s a huge range of different kinds of drinks and cocktails. The interior really has a Mexican feel with colorful elements. As the place is pretty dark, it’s not a perfect spot for Instagram photos but it is perfect for good Mexican food!

## Luigi’s Hot Pizza
 
[Luigi’s Hot Pizza][luigis]{:target="_blank"} is a huge open-aired space with picnic tables, which kind of makes it feel like you’re at a festival. You have to order and pay your food and drinks at the specific counters and have to pick up your food when it’s ready (you’ll get a timer, so you know when it’s ready). We always like this concept as it makes it possible to have a quick bite without feeling like you’re really going out for a fancy dinner. The pizzas were good and the atmosphere was great. During the night this place is bustling with many groups of friends having drinks and pizzas.

## Mad Pops
 
[Mad Pops][mad pops]{:target="_blank"} is a must visit when you’re in Canggu. This Insta-famous ice cream shops sells vegan ice cream and they have the cutest neon sign walls. You can’t leave Bali without a photo in front of the Mad Pops neon sign. Their ice cream is yummy too!

## Paletas Wey
 
[Paletas Wey][paletas wey]{:target="_blank"} is another ice cream shop in Canggu selling ice cream popsicles. Their popsicles are colorful and they have a few very pretty walls that serve as a great backdrop for photos. It’s the perfect place for having a nice popsicle and taking a pretty photo for the Gram!

Four days isn’t nearly enough to check out all the amazing food Canggu has to offer, but it’s the perfect amount of time to recharge after 1,5 weeks of [exploring Bali][things ubud]{:target="_blank"} and [Nusa Penida][things nusa penida]{:target="_blank"} while enjoying some good food.
