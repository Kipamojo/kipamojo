If you’re as mesmerized by the Sydney Opera House as we were, you probably can’t stop taking pictures from every angle. So, we created this list of the best photo spots of the Opera House and mapped the locations for you!

## Hickson Road Reserve

The Hickson Road Reserve is a small park next to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Besides taking photos of all angles possible of the Harbour Bridge, this place also offers a beautiful view of the Opera House.

## Campbell’s Cove Jetty

Walking from Hickson Road Reserve to Circular Quay, you’ll walk along a ledge. The ledge near Campbell’s Cove Jetty is a beautiful spot to take a picture of you sitting on the ledge with the Opera House in the background. It’s a beautiful spot during the day, but even better with the stunning Australian sunset sky in the background.

## Overseas Passenger Terminal

If you’re lucky, you might catch a sunset without a huge cruise ship blocking the view of the Opera House from the Overseas Passenger Terminal. Usually there is a cruise ship at the Overseas Passenger Terminal but one evening the cruise ship left the harbor before sunset. The view of the Opera House is beautiful from the Overseas Passenger Terminal.

## Rooftop of the Sydney Museum of Contemporary Art

The Museum of Contemporary Art has a rooftop bar which offers a beautiful view of the Sydney Opera House. Try to catch the sunset on a Wednesday evening, the only evening the rooftop bar is open.
There’s no entrance fee (and there’s no need to order anything if you just want to take photos).

Opening hours:  
Thursdays – Tuesdays: 10.00-17.00  
Wednesdays: 10.00-21.00

## The Sydney Opera House Stairs

The stairs in front of the Sydney Opera House are perfect for taking some nice pictures. These stairs can get very crowded though so if you want to take a picture without the crowds, go early.

Besides the stairs, it’s also fun to walk around the Opera House itself and shoot different perspectives from up close. If you go during the golden hour, the Opera House is lit up by the sun and looks like it’s glowing.

## Sydney Royal Botanic Garden

Walking along the water in the Royal Botanic Garden will offer many different photo opportunities of the Opera House. You can walk all the way to Mrs Macquaries Point for an iconic photo of the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge together.

## Take the ferry to or from Circular Quay

Circular Quay is a ferry terminal and all ferries will drive past the Opera House. We took the ferry from Watsons Bay multiple times, but there are more places where you can board a ferry to Circular Quay and you can also take a ferry departing from Circular Quay. Shooting the Opera House from the water offers a whole new perspective. We advise to take a ferry that’s approaching east of the Opera House, so you’ll see the Opera House from all sides (except the front).
