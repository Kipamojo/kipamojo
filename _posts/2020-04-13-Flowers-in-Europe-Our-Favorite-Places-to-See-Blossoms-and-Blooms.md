# Let us take you on a blossoming virtual vacation!

Science says flowers improve emotional health and have an immediate effect on happiness. We’re glad our feelings are confirmed by scientists. Nothing makes us (mostly Mika) more happy than a garden filled with flowers, or a cherry blossom tree in full bloom. If you follow us on Instagram, you know that we love taking flower pics. In every place we visit, we keep our eyes peeled for flowers and, as a result, we stumble upon many. 

Now that we can’t visit these places in person, we’re dreaming about all the beautiful flower destinations we’ve been to over the past years. In this post we’re taking you with us on this virtual flower vacation! 

## Bonn, Germany

Bonn is famous for its cherry blossom street: Heerstrasse. During spring, Heerstrasse completely turns pink. Both sides of the street are filled with cherry blossom trees and it’s a delight to see. Heerstrasse isn’t the only place where you can find cherry blossom trees in Bonn though. Wandering around the city you’ll stumble upon many more!

## Cologne, Germany

Cologne is only a 30-minute ride away from Bonn and another place with beautiful cherry blossoms. You’ll find plenty along the Rhine river!

## Tulips in the Netherlands

Every spring, the Netherlands attracts thousands of tourists to its tulip fields. We can’t blame them: we hop in the car to witness these beauties every year too. You’ll find tulip fields everywhere scattered across the Netherlands. It’s a beautiful sight, both from the ground as well from the sky.

## Amstelveen, the Netherlands

The Amsterdam Forest in Amstelveen has its own cherry blossom park. It’s a small park filled with 400 cherry blossom trees and it’s absolutely stunning!

## Madrid, Spain

Madrid might not be on the top of your head when thinking about spring blooms, but the capital of Spain actually has a lot to offer. Madrid’s huge city park, Parque del Buen Retiro, has a few gardens filled with flowers. The Rose Garden and Cecilio Rodriguez Garden are by far our favorites. Their flowers are so beautiful.

## Zagreb, Croatia

Zagreb is a dream during Spring. Wandering around the city, you’ll stumble upon lots of tulips, cherry blossom trees, magnolia trees and many more! The city really puts in lots of effort to make it a dreamy spring destination.

## Oslo, Norway

Oslo’s main bloom are the beautiful wild flowers that you’ll find scattered across the city. Just keep your eyes peeled for brightly colored flowers and you’ll see so many!

## Vienna, Austria

Vienna already is a dreamy city with amazing architecture and lots of palaces, but they put in a lot of effort to make the gardens look great too. Literally every public garden in Vienna is filled with beautiful flowers. And some of the gardens are huge, which means lots of flower happiness!

## Strasbourg, France

Along the canals in Strasbourg, you’ll find lots of potted flowers. The historic center of Strasbourg is pretty by itself already, but with the addition of all the flowers, it makes it even better!

## Lake Bled, Slovenia

Bled has become a well-known fairy-tale-like destination in Europe. Of course, Lake Bled is famous for its idyllic island in the middle, the crystal clear blue waters and the stunning mountain scenery surrounding it, but did you know it has some beautiful flowers too? There’s a beautiful rose field right on the lake’s shoreline. When you think it can’t get any dreamier, think again!

## Gran Canaria, Spain

Puerto de Mogan in Gran Canaria is gorgeous. Everywhere in the small village you’ll find the prettiest pink, red and orange-toned blooms. We don’t think we’ve ever seen a village more picturesque than Puerto de Mogan!

## Prague, Czech Republic

Scattered throughout the city, you can find lots of roses in Prague. Even though we were a bit late for the rose season, we could still see how many there used to be. Especially in the parks and gardens, you’ll find lots. 

{% include img-center.html path="/assets/img/kipamojo-flowers-europe-prague.jpg" alt="Flowers in Prague, Czech Republic" %}

## Ljubljana, Slovenia

Ljubljana is known as the green capital of Europe and as you’ll find lots of greenery in the city center, you’ll also find lots of blooms. Especially the nature parks close to the city center are filled with beautiful flowers.

## Lille, France

Wandering around Lille, we stumbled upon many pretty rose gardens. Just a few steps outside of the shopping center of Lille we found various small parks with lots of roses. All these roses give the city such a romantic vibe!

## At home

You probably don’t need to travel to see pretty blossoms and blooms. Just keep your eyes peeled next time you’re going for a walk in your neighborhood. Cherry blossom trees are literally everywhere. It depends on the kind of tree when it blossoms, but it’s always between late March and Mid-April. We also noticed that you can find lots of cherry blossom trees in residential areas. For all kinds of other flowers: get into all the parks in your area during different times in spring. We bet you can find plenty. Going for walks is just one of the things we love to do during spring as it’s so rewarding! (Unless you live in the desert of course.)

Here are some of our spring finds in our hometown Dordrecht, the Netherlands.
