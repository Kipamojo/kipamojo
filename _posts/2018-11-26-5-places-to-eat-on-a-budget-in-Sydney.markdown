In this post, we share with you our favorite places to eat in Sydney. These places to eat in Sydney are all budget-proof and perfect for 'quick' dinners (nothing too fancy), which we prefer while traveling. Moreover, all of these places to eat are near Circular Quay, which is our favorite area in Sydney. 

## 1. Vapiano

If you’ve read our [Brisbane itinerary][brisbane itinerary]{:target="_blank"}, you know we were surprised to discover a Vapiano restaurant in Brisbane. As we often go to Vapiano back home, we decided to try the Vapiano in Sydney as well! We love their pizzas a lot and, even though they’re a bit more expensive in Australia than they are in the Netherlands, it’s still a cheap and easy place to have dinner. Just don’t expect anything fancy, you have to pick up your own drinks and pizzas from the counter.

## 2. Burger Project 

At Burger Project they serve burgers (duh!). You can compose the burgers yourself and add toppings to your own taste. Just like Vapiano, it’s an easy, fast and cheap place to eat and the burgers were very good. When you’re traveling full-time and eating out every day, these are the kind of places you’re looking for (besides McDonald’s, haha). Burger Project is located in a mall filled with restaurants (Gateway Sydney), so you can always choose to eat somewhere else.

## 3. Four Frogs Crêperie

All kinds of crepes are served at Four Frogs Crêperie. We actually ate here twice, because we liked it so much. You can go for a savory or a sweet crepe, or have a savory crepe for dinner and a sweet crepe for dessert like we did! The crepes are just really good, and the staff is also very nice. It’s also a plus that there’s an outdoor seating area. This place is definitely worth checking out!

## 4. Buckley’s Sydney

Buckley’s is located along Circular Quay and has a huge outdoor seating area. We came here for drinks during happy hour and stayed for food. You have to order and pay at the bar, after which you are handed a number to place on your table. They’ll serve your drinks and food when it’s ready. The prices are very reasonable, especially considering the location of the place. It’s also the perfect spot for people watching!

## 5. Gelato Messina

We ate the most delicious ice cream at Gelato Messina. If you’re in the Circular Quay area on a hot day, it’s a must to get an ice cream here. Try their mint ice cream, it really tastes like mint leaves and it’s so good!
