There is a lot to see in the city center of Singapore that doesn’t require a budget, with Marina Bay situated at its core. A walk along the 3.5 km-long Marina Bay Promenade offers you some amazing views. The Marina Bay Sands resort can be seen from all around the Bay, which is great for some beautiful photos. The skyscrapers in the financial district on the south side of the Bay are also great for some breathtaking shots. In the evening, all the buildings around the Bay light up resulting in some beautiful reflections in the water of Marina Bay.

The Shoppes at Marina Bay mall is located on the west side of the Bay, just in front of the Marina Bay Sands resort. Walking along the Marina Bay Promenade can be very hot and exhaustive. The air-conditioned Shoppes offer some refreshment from the hot and humid Singaporean weather. The mall itself is very beautiful so the eye won’t miss a thing. As the Shoppes offer a wide variety of luxury brands, walking through the mall will only allow window shopping.

The fountain show Spectra is played multiple times an evening along the Marina Bay Promenade, just in front of the Shoppes. It is a show of water and light and lasts 15 minutes. It’s a must see if you’re visiting Singapore!

The Gardens by the Bay are located at the other side of the Marina Bay Sands resort. A large part of the garden is freely accessible without any charges. Watch the impressive supertrees and take some beautiful shots along the way. In the evening, the supertrees are lit up and even more impressive than during daytime.

The Singapore river is located on the west side of Marina Bay. Walking along the river will lead you to some beautiful places. Along the Queen Elizabeth Walk you will find beautiful Victorian architectural styled buildings, including the Asian Civilsations Museum, the Victorian Theatre and the National Gallery Singapore.

The Fullerton Building, which is located at the other side of the rives, used to be the General Post Office but currently houses a five-star hotel. It is one of the oldest buildings you can find in this part of the city. Walking further along the river will get you to Clarke Quay where you can find various restaurants and nightclubs. The colorful warehouses are lovely to look at!

A 15-minute walk from Clarke Quay will bring you to Singaporean Chinatown. Chinatown offers some cute houses and lovely streets, which are all – of course – in Chinese style. You will find shops and stalls and even some pagodas. Pagoda Street is one of the most photogenic streets of Chinatown: a Chinese looking street with colorful lanterns and – as a finishing touch – a beautiful skyline in the background.
