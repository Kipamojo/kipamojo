## Gallery of Modern Art

Modern Art usually works well on pictures. Big pro is that the light in the gallery is perfect for taking pictures too. Find your favorite art piece and shoot away!

## Wilson Outlook Reserve

From the Wilson Outlook Reserve you’ll have a perfect view over the Story Bridge and the skyscrapers behind it. At night, the bridge is lit up in different colors. As there is quite some lack of light at the reserve, it might be hard to properly light up both yourself and the background for an Insta picture at night. So, if you want to be in the shot, you should go during the day or use a flash.

## Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary

You can’t leave Australia without a picture of you and a kangaroo. Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary is perfect for that. There is a large field with 150 freely roaming kangaroos. These kangaroos are very approachable and if you buy some food at the store, they’ll come to you for sure. There are also many cute koalas to photograph and you can even hold one, if you’d like to.
