After a few intense days of exploring Koh Yao Yai, we needed to unwind for a bit. Krabi Town doesn’t necessarily sound like the perfect location for that, but it did the job very well. Our days consisted of going out for breakfast, solving some laptop issues (*sigh*), having lunch, walking around town, having dinner and grabbing a smoothie at the market.

Krabi Town was the cheapest place we’ve been to in Thailand with the best (western) food! We specifically loved [May and Mark’s House][may and mark's]{:target="_blank"} where we ate at least twice a day.

We loved walking along the [river][Krabi river]{:target="_blank"} and enjoying the views from there. Every night there was a [night market][night market]{:target="_blank"} with different kinds of (Thai) food, but we loved the food at May and Mark’s so much that we didn’t want to eat anywhere else.

Many people staying in or around Krabi Town visit the [Tiger Cave Temple][tiger cave temple]{:target="_blank"} (Wat Tham Suea). The temple is located on top of hill and offers beautiful views. It’s just a 10-minute ride from Krabi Town, but we were way too tired to head that way and climb 1237 stairs in the tropical heat. 

Krabi Town is a nice and relaxed town. It’s not that big so everything is easily reachable on foot. Since hotels and food prices aren’t expensive at all and it’s not that far from the coast, Krabi Town is a good place to stay if you want to explore the area by scooter or motorbike.
