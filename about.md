Welcome to our Travel Blog!  
  
We are Joop & Mika, a Dutch couple that loves to travel. In November 2017, we went on our first big trip together and traveled full-time through Asia for over 6 months. Since then, we haven't stopped traveling. We're currently back home in the Netherlands but we take on every opportunity to travel and see more of the world. On this blog we share our experiences and travel tips with you.
